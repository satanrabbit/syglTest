Mosaiqy is a thumbnail/zoom viewer plugin for jQuery 1.6+.
Thumbnails are arranged in a grid and each row and column could be randomically moved,
sliding in every direction and showing other thumbnails available.
Image data is described as a regular JSON object. 


Technical in-depth detail 

- Mosaiqy has been developed using some concepts of inheritance pattern for large
  jQuery application and the Module pattern;

- In development version all Javascript methods are full-documented, according to
  the JsDoc syntax;
  
- Only main plugin extends $.fn (jQuery.prototype). Other internal chained method
  have been subclassed with $.sub().
  
- Use of $.Deferred objects available only from jQuery 1.5 for asynchronous images
  load.
  
- Use of CSS3 transitions and transformation where available. Animations are taken
  over by the GPU on newer browser so they take benefit of the hardware acceleration.
